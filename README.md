Experiments in reinforcement learning using java and dl4j

Run TDZero for a TD(0) based learner with tables.
QLambda is an implementation that makes use of eligibility traces
TDZeroNN and QLambdaNN are the same, but instead of a lookup table, they use a neural network as a function approximator. Unfortunately, this doesn't work yet. Anybody willing to help?

For the neural nets we use the deeplearning4j framework.
